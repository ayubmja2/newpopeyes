#This is a Popeyes Clone web Application.

##Developer: Name Ayub Ali.

To Make this very clear: **All Brand Rights belong to Popeyes.inc** I own none of the Brand assets such as **images brand id, Logo and etc**

What does belong to me is the web application code and design of the Popeyes Clone. This is just a fun web project
to build my Front-End and my BackEnd development skill.

It uses Tailwind, Next.js/react for frontend and
uses Postgresql backend db and Prisma as the ORM
